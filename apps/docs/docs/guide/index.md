# Introduction

Welcome to **DevKit** â€” a full-stack application framework built for speed, structure, and code generation. Whether you're building a scalable API or a polished admin panel, DevKit provides a clean and opinionated foundation to help you move fast with confidence.

## What is DevKit?

DevKit is a modular framework that combines a gRPC-based backend with a Vue-powered frontend UI system, enhanced by a powerful CLI that scaffolds new features across the stack.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **CLI-first developer workflow** â€” Generate projects, domains, endpoints, and UI features with a single command
- **Backend built with Go** â€” Clean architecture with gRPC, SQLC, Connect, and Supabase
- **Frontend powered by Vue 3** â€” Composable component suite built with Vite, TailwindCSS, PrimeVue, and FormKit
- **Admin-ready** â€” Prebuilt admin panel template with authentication, roles, and user management
- **Code-first, not config-heavy** â€” Emphasizes convention over abstraction for rapid development
- **Flexible** â€” Works with gRPC, REST, or any structured API SDK

## Who is it for?

DevKit is ideal for:

- Full-stack developers who want a fast, consistent scaffold for modern apps
- Teams building SaaS platforms, admin dashboards, or internal tools
- Engineers who prefer **code generation** over deep abstraction layers
- Projects that benefit from tight API-UI integration

## What's Included?

- `devkit` CLI to generate projects, domains, endpoints, and components
- `devkit-api`: gRPC backend with modular domains and SQL-based persistence
- `@devkitvue/*`: Vue package suite with reusable UI, forms, tables, file manager, and admin shell
- `devkit-admin-example`: Ready-to-run admin template with integrated API client
