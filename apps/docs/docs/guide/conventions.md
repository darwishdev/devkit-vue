# Folder Conventions

DevKit promotes consistency and maintainability through a clear folder structure across both the **API** and **Admin** projects. This guide explains how to organize your files, write scalable code, and locate functionality at a glance.

## ðŸ§± API Project Structure

Each DevKit API project follows a **modular domain-based structure**:

```
my-backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ accounts/             # Domain name
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ adapter/          # Request/response mapping (API â‡„ usecase â‡„ DB)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ repo/             # Query logic and interfaces
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ usecase/          # Core business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                      # gRPC server bindings and endpoint wiring
â”œâ”€â”€ proto/                    # Protobuf service & message definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ init/                 # Supabase seed scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries/              # SQLc queries for each feature
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migration/            # SQL migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ testdata/                 # Test fixtures and sample payloads
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/                 # Internal tools/utilities
â””â”€â”€ main.go                   # Entry point
```

**Domain Layering**

Each domain (e.g. `accounts`) follows a clean architecture pattern:

- `adapter/`: Transforms incoming gRPC/REST requests into internal structs (e.g. SQL params), and maps DB/query results back into API responses.
- `repo/`: Interface + implementation for data access
- `usecase/`: Core business rules and logic. The usecase layer acts as the orchestration layer â€” from here, you invoke the adapter to prepare inputs and parse outputs, and call the repo layer to execute queries or persistence operations

The CLI auto-generates this structure when running `devkit new domain`.

## ðŸ§© Admin Panel Structure

Admin panels scaffolded with DevKit follow a structured layout to promote separation of concerns:

```
my-admin/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accounts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants/                # Field and route metadata
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user/views/               # Views: List, Create, Update, etc.
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ role/views/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session/views/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public/                       # Public features like files
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ file/views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                          # API client (Connect + Buf)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/                   # Layouts and base components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/                      # i18n, toast, formkit config
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router/                       # App routes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ style/                        # Tailwind + PrimeVue overrides
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/                        # Shared type declarations
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/                        # Utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/                            # Entry views like login, dashboard
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.ts                           # App entrypoint
```

**Key Folder Purposes**

- `app/`: Feature modules organized by domain
- `pkg/`: Shared plugins, layouts, and logic
- `views/`: Top-level public views (Login, NotFound, etc.)

Each feature folder (`user`, `role`, etc.) contains Vue views following the CRUD model:

- `FeatureListView.vue`
- `FeatureCreateView.vue`
- `FeatureUpdateView.vue`
- `FeatureFindView.vue`

These are auto-generated with `devkit new feature`.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Keep your logic per domain, even shared logic (donâ€™t centralize prematurely)
- Use CLI commands to scaffold domains, features, and endpoints consistently
- Avoid creating new base layers unless absolutely necessary â€” rely on DevKit structure
